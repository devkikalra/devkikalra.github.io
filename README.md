I have correctly implemented a resume.html, bio.html, and index.html file. I used my real details (name, email, education, work experience, interests, etc.) for all webpages. My web page can be accessed at https://devkikalra.github.io/. 

Additionally, I have verified the following: 
- All my HTML files pass the official HTML5 specifications via: https://validator.w3.org/
- I implemented 3 CSS files with more than 5 rules 
- All my CSS files pass the official CSS validations via: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- I didn't use any frames 
- I didn't use any styling elements
- All styling was defined in CSS files
- I didn't use any styling atributes in elements 
- I used only relative URLs for images
- I didn't use any front-end frameworks 
- All CSS files are my own 
- I didn't use JavaScript or jQuery 
- All file names are lowercase and with standard characters 
- Everything is stored in this repo

One thing I would like to note â€” I didn't use git consistently enough (because I completely forgot) and struggled with some of the commands (I'm still getting used to it). I worked 
completely independently on the project and this took me around 10 - 12 hours over the course of 4-5 days.
